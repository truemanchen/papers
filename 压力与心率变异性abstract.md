# abstract

Mental stress reduces performances, on the work place and in daily life, and is one of the first causes of cognitive dysfunctions, cardiovascular disorders and depression. 

**精神压力会降低工作场所和日常生活中的表现，并且是造成认知功能障碍，心血管疾病和抑郁症的首要原因之一。**

This study systematically reviewed existing literature investigating, in healthy subjects, the associations between acute mental stress and short term Heart Rate Variability (HRV) measures in time, frequency and non-linear domain. 

***这项研究系统地回顾了在健康受试者中研究急性精神压力与短期心率变异性（HRV）度量在时间，频率和非线性范围之间的关联的现有文献。***

The goal of this study was to provide reliable information about the trends and the pivot values of HRV measures during mental stress. 

**这项研究的目的是提供有关精神压力期间HRV措施的趋势和关键值的可靠信息。**

A systematic review and meta-analysis of the evidence was conducted, performing an exhaustive research of electronic repositories and linear researching references of papers responding to the inclusion criteria.

**对证据进行了系统的审查和荟萃分析，对电子存储库进行了详尽的研究，并对纳入标准做出了线性研究。**

 After removing duplicates and not pertinent papers, journal papers describing well-designed studies that analyzed rigorously HRV were included if analyzed the same population of healthy subjects at rest and during mental stress. 

**删除重复的文章而不是相关文章之后，如果分析经过精心设计的研究并严格分析HRV的期刊论文，就会发现这些研究则包括在休息和精神压力相同的健康受试者群体中进行分析的情况。**

12 papers were shortlisted, enrolling overall 758 volunteers and investigating 22 different HRV measures, 9 of which reported by at least 2 studies and therefore meta-analyzed in this review.

**入围了12篇论文，总共招募了758名志愿者，并调查了22种不同的HRV措施，其中至少9项研究报告了9项，因此在本次综述中进行了荟萃分析。**

 Four measures in time and non-linear domains, associated with a normal degree of HRV variations resulted significantly depressed during stress. 

**在压力下，与正常HRV变化程度相关的时域和非线性域的四种测量结果显着降低。**

The power of HRV fluctuations at high frequencies was significantly depressed during stress, while the ratio between low and high frequency resulted significantly increased, suggesting a sympathetic activation and a parasympathetic withdrawal during acute mental stress. 

**应激期间，高频HRV波动的力量显着降低，而低频与高频之间的比率显着增加，表明在急性精神应激期间有交感神经激活和副交感神经退缩。**

Finally, among the 15 non-linear measures extracted, only 2 were reported by at least 2 studies, therefore pooled, and only one resulted significantly depressed, suggesting a reduced chaotic behaviour during mental stress. 

**最后，在提取的15种非线性测量中，至少有2项研究报告了2项，因此进行了汇总，并且只有1项结果显着降低了情绪，表明精神压力期间的混沌行为有所减少。**

HRV resulted significantly depressed during mental stress, showing a reduced variability and less chaotic behaviour. 

**在精神压力期间，HRV显著降低，表现出变异性降低和混乱行为减少。**

The pooled frequency domain measures demonstrated a significant autonomic balance shift during acute mental stress towards the sympathetic activation and the parasympathetic withdrawal.

**合并的频域测量结果表明，在急性精神压力下，自发性平衡明显向着交感神经激活和副交感神经退缩转变。**

 Pivot values for the pooled mean differences of HRV measures are provided. Further studies investigating HRV non-linear measures during mental stress are still required. 

**提供了HRV度量的合并平均差的枢轴值。仍需要进一步研究精神压力期间HRV非线性测量。**

However, the method proposed to transform and then meta-analyze the HRV measures can be applied to other fields where HRV proved to be clinically significant.

**但是，提出的对HRV度量进行转化然后进行荟萃分析的方法可以应用于HRV被证明具有临床意义的其他领域**

# conclusion

In conclusion, these review proved that there was consensus about the HRV measures changing consistently during mental stress.

总之，这些评论证明，在精神压力期间，HRV测量一直在变化。

 Particularly, the results of the pooling of the HRV measures, provided pivot values for at least 7 HRV measures that changed significantly during stressing sections. 

特别是，HRV量度的合并结果为至少7个HRV量度提供了枢轴值，这些值在压力期间发生了显着变化。

These significant changes confirmed previous results about the inducted shift of the ANS balance towards the sympathetic activation and the parasympathetic withdrawal during acute mental stress. 

**这些重大变化证实了先前关于急性精神压力期间ANS平衡朝着交感神经激活和副交感神经退缩转变的结果。**

However, a huge heterogeneity among studies investigating physiological response to mental stress was observed in this review. 

然而，在这篇综述中，在研究对精神压力的生理反应的研究之间存在巨大的异质性。

Moreover,this review proved that future studies are needed to confirm the behaviour of non-linear HRV measures during stress.

**此外，本综述证明，需要进一步的研究来确认压力下非线性HRV测量的行为。**

 Finally, future studies are recommended to: define the study design (i.e. length of HRV measures) and the study protocol (i.e. definition of stressor, avoid physical activity if not required) according to the best available evidence; 

最后，建议未来的研究：根据最佳证据确定研究设计（即HRV量度的长度）和研究方案（即压力源的定义，如果不需要，避免进行体育锻炼）；

to analyses the HRV features (i.e. using measurement units according to international guidelines); to use statistical tests consistently with the HRV measure distribution (i.e. check if HRV measures are normally distributed of not); to check HRV stationary if HRV measures are longer than 5 min; to measure stressing session according to the goal of the study (i.e. during, before or after the stressing session).

分析HRV特征（即根据国际准则使用测量单位）;使用与HRV度量分布一致的统计检验（即检查HRV度量是否正态分布）;如果HRV措施超过5分钟，则检查HRV是否静止；根据研究目标（即在压力测试期间，之前或之后）测量压力测试。
